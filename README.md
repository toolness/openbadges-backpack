# Mozilla Open Badges Backpack [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mozilla/openbadges-backpack.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mozilla/openbadges-backpack)

This is version 1.1 of the Open Badges Backpack, rebuilt from the
ground up.

## Prerequisites

Node 0.10.

[PhantomJS][] 1.8 or later is used to automatically run the
browser-side tests from the command-line, but this can be optionally
disabled.

## Quick Start

```
git clone git://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack.git
cd openbadges-backpack
npm install
npm test
DEBUG= COOKIE_SECRET=cookie node bin/backpack.js
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000.

## Environment Variables

**Note:** When an environment variable is described as representing a
boolean value, if the variable exists with *any* value (even the empty
string), the boolean is true; otherwise, it's false.

* `COOKIE_SECRET` is the secret used to encrypt and sign cookies,
  to prevent tampering.

* `DEBUG` represents a boolean value. Setting this to true makes the server
  use unminified source code on the client-side, among other things.

* `ORIGIN` is the origin of the server, as it appears
  to users. If `DEBUG` is enabled, this defaults to
  `http://localhost:PORT`. Otherwise, it must be defined.

* `ENABLE_STUBBYID` represents a boolean value. If it *and* `DEBUG` are
  both true, then the [stubbyid][] persona simulator is enabled. This allows
  anyone to easily log in as anyone they want, which makes manual testing
  and debugging easier. However, it should also *never* be enabled on
  production sites, which is why `DEBUG` must also be enabled for this
  feature to work.

* `PORT` is the port that the server binds to. Defaults to 3000.

* `SSL_KEY` is the path to a private key to use for SSL. If this
  is provided, the server must be accessed over HTTPS rather
  than HTTP, and the `SSL_CERT` environment variable must also
  be defined.

* `SSL_CERT` is the path to a SSL certificate. If this
  is provided, the server must be accessed over HTTPS rather
  than HTTP, and the `SSL_KEY` environment variable must also
  be defined.

## Tests

All unit and acceptance tests can be run via `npm test`.

### Unit Tests

Individual unit test suites can be run via
<code>node_modules/.bin/mocha test/<em>filename</em></code>, where
*filename* is the name of the test. See [mocha(1)][] for more options.

By default, PhantomJS is used to run the browser-side unit tests, but they
can be skipped if the `DISABLE_PHANTOM_TESTS` environment variable is
defined.

### Acceptance Tests

We use [cucumber][] for acceptance testing. To run the acceptance tests,
run `node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js -f pretty`.

### Test Coverage

Build/install [jscoverage][], run `make test-cov`, then open
`coverage.html` in a browser.

Coverage should always be at 100%. Pull requests that break this will
be rejected.
